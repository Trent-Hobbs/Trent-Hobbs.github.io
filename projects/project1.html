        <h2>Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          A suspicious file was identified on a company web server, raising alarms within the intranet. The Development team flagged the anomaly, 
          suspecting potential malicious activity. To address the issue, the network team captured critical network traffic and prepared a PCAP file for review.
          Your task is to analyze the provided PCAP file to uncover how the file appeared and determine the extent of any unauthorized activity.

        <h2>Question 1: Geograpic Location</h2>
        <p>
          We can find the ip address that were involved in this attack by going to statistics > conversations > IPv4. 
          We can use this information and find where the source IP (117.11.88.124) makes a connection with the 
          destination (24.49.63.79). Then if we use a useful website like https://ipgeolocation.io/ we can find 
          out the location of the source IP.

        <h2>Question 2: User-Agent</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the term User-Agent is half of understanding the solution to this question. A User-Agent 
          is a string of text that identifies the client software (e.g., a web browser, application, or script) 
          making a request to a server. It is part of the HTTP headers sent during web requests and provides 
          information about the client's operating system, browser type, version, and sometimes additional 
          details like device type or rendering engine. Because we know that it is part of the HTTP header 
          we can look at the GET http request from the source IP in China. By right clicking the packet and 
          using Follow > http steam we can find the User-Agent. </p>

        <h2>Question 3: Damage Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Assessing the situation and analysing the successful attacks by the hacker is always imperative in network 
          traffic analysis. The attacker made two attempts that can be viewed by using this filter 
          ip.src == 117.11.88.124" and http.request.method=="POST". By using the follow > http stream function of 
          wireshark, you are able to investigate these packets further to see which of the two were successfully uploaded.

        <h2>Question 4: Uploaded Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Identifing where uploaded files are located is crucial for understanding the intent of the 
          attacker and for the removal of the files. This can be done by using the search filter "http.request.method == POST" 
          and looking for the uploaded filename.

        <h2>Question 5: Exfiltrated Files</h2>
        <p>
          In order for the attacker to recieve a file from the target machine, the targeted machine will send an HTTP POST packet. 
          You can filter for this with ip.src == "targeted machine ip" and looking for the String "POST". Then by inspecting 
            the packet you are able to find the name of the file that was exfiltrated.  Edit with proper grammer
