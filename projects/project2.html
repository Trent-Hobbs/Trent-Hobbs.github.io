    <h2>Scenario </h2>
    <p>Your organization's security team has detected a surge in suspicious network activity. 
      There are concerns that LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS 
      (NetBIOS Name Service) poisoning attacks may be occurring within your network. 
      These attacks are known for exploiting these protocols to intercept network traffic 
      and potentially compromise user credentials. Your task is to investigate the network 
      logs and examine captured network traffic.</p>

      <h2>Question 1: Mistyped Query</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocol is critical for the completion of this lab. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a name resolution protocol used in local 
        networks when DNS is unavailable. It allows devices to resolve names to IP addresses 
        without a central DNS server. However, due to its lack of authentication, attackers can 
        exploit LLMNR by responding with spoofed IP addresses, leading to traffic interception 
        or credential theft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) is an older name resolution protocol used in legacy 
        Windows networks to map NetBIOS names to IP addresses. Like LLMNR, NBT-NS lacks 
        authentication, making it vulnerable to spoofing attacks where malicious actors 
        can redirect traffic or harvest credentials through network poisoning techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the scenario description we are told that LLMNR and NBT-NS is being targeted 
        so by filtering for them we can find the mistyped query. Ex. ip.src==192.168.232.162 and nbns

      <h2>Question 2: Rogue IP Address</h2>
      <p>
        We know this is a poisoning attack so we should look for the mistyped query's response. 
        The attacker is trying to intercept this response so we can find the IP of the rogue machine.

        <h2>Question 3: Secondary Target</h2>
        <p>
          You can find all the interactions between each IP in statistics > conversations > 
          IPv4. The rogue IP has only interacted with one other IP address.

      <h2>Question 4: Comprimised Username</h2>
      <p>
       The SMB protocol integrates NT LAN Manager authentication which can contain information about 
       the session. In our case the most relevant is the session setup response with contains the 
       username. ip.dst==192.168.232.215 and smb2 isolates the rogue machine.

        <h2>Question 5: Target's Hostname</h2>
        <p>
          Continuing in this packet you can find more information about the session. The target info field shows the DNS computer name and thus the hostname.
